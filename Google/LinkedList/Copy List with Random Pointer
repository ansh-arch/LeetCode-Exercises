A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or null.
Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of 
its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers 
in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.
Return the head of the copied linked list.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:
val: an integer representing Node.val
random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.

Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.

Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]

Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]

public class Solution {
    public Node CopyRandomList(Node head) {
        //Value of deep copy same as the original node
        if (head == null) return null;

    // Step 1: Clone each node and insert it right after the original node
    Node curr = head;
    while (curr != null) {
        Node copy = new Node(curr.val);//Value of current node
        copy.next = curr.next; //Reference of current node
        //Now add it to the right of that original node 
        curr.next = copy;
        //Now increase it for next node
        curr = copy.next;
    }

    // Step 2: Assign random pointers to the cloned nodes
    //Each original node is followed by its clone (curr.next).
    curr = head;
    while (curr != null) {
        //Assign random pointer to clone
        if (curr.random != null) {
            curr.next.random = curr.random.next;
        }
        //Move to next original node
        curr = curr.next.next;
    }

    // Step 3: Separate the cloned list from the original
    curr = head;
    Node dummy = new Node(0);
    Node copyCurr = dummy;

    while (curr != null) {
        copyCurr.next = curr.next;
        curr.next = curr.next.next;//Further set next 

        curr = curr.next;
        copyCurr = copyCurr.next;
    }

    return dummy.next;
