You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

public bool CanJump(int[] nums) {
        /* One of comments from Discussions ----------------------------
        The article is much more complicated than the problem itself.
I thought of the problem as I have X liters of gasoline at start.
And I consume one every time I go to the next station.
But at every station I can replace the tank with a new one containing station provided liters of gasoline.
If you run out of gasoline, you can not go further.
If you reach last station you made it, hurray! */

        int gasoline = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.Length; i++) {
            if (gasoline == 0) {
                return false;
            }
            gasoline = Math.Max(gasoline-1, nums[i]);
        }
        return true;

    }
