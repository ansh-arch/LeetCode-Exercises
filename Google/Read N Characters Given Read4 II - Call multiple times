Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement a method read to read n characters. Your method read may be called multiple times.
Method read4:
The API read4 reads four consecutive characters from file, then writes those characters into the buffer array buf4.
The return value is the number of actual characters read.
Note that read4() has its own file pointer, much like FILE *fp in C.

File file("abcde"); // File is "abcde", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 = "abcd", fp points to 'e'
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 = "e", fp points to end of file
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 = "", fp points to end of file

Input: file = "abc", queries = [1,2,1]
Output: [1,2,0]
Explanation: The test case represents the following scenario:
File file("abc");
Solution sol;
sol.read(buf, 1); // After calling your read method, buf should contain "a". We read a total of 1 character from the file, so return 1.
sol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain "bc". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.

public class Solution : Reader4 {
    /**
     * @param buf Destination buffer
     * @param n   Number of characters to read
     * @return    The number of actual characters read
     */
    int start = 0, end = 0;
    char[] buf4 = new char[4];
    public int Read(char[] buf, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while(count < n && (start < end || (start = 0) < (end = Read4(buf4))))
            buf[count++] = buf4[start++];
        return count;
    }
}
