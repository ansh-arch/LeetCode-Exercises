Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., √(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].

public class Solution {
    public int[][] KClosest(int[][] points, int k) {
        
        // Sort points by distance from origin
        Array.Sort(points, (a, b) =>
        {
            int distA = a[0] * a[0] + a[1] * a[1];
            int distB = b[0] * b[0] + b[1] * b[1];
            return distA.CompareTo(distB);
        });

        // Take first k points
        int[][] result = new int[k][];
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
        {
            result[i] = points[i];
        }

        return result;

    }
}
